# 📦 GPP (GdePosylka Parser)
GPP is a C++/Qt library built for working with the GdePosylka/PackageRadar services for package tracking. It is built on HTML parsing using the [mylogin/htmlparser](https://github.com/mylogin/htmlparser) library.

## 🛠️ Build Instructions
To build the project, simply download and install Qt version 6 or higher, open the project in Qt Creator, and build it.  
__!!NLOAHMAN_JSON LIBRARY IS REQUERED!!__
Use `-DGPP_LIBRARY_BUILD_STATIC=true` to build a static lib.   
All compilers are supported, but debug version is only for g++/MinGW!    
Qt 5 should also work, but it is not recommended as it has not been tested. Anyway, you can fix some compatibility errors by yourself!
